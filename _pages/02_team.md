<p>We are a diverse group comprised mostly of political science doctoral students at the University of Michigan committed to helping organizations that serve marginalized communities. In addition to our our methodological and statistical training, collectively we have experience in working with a diverse array of data, substantive experience in public opinion, communication, political campaigns, and political advocacy. Members of our group have prior professional experience among other things as software developers, designers, nonprofit researchers, consumer market researchers and project managers.</p>
