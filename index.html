<p>Political Scientists for Social Responsibility is committed to providing pro-bono political science and research consultancy to organizations that serve marginalized or vulnerable populations. We believe the integration of research practices, and academic knowledge with social justice oriented work can help improve how organizations serve their communities. We want to help you and your organization more effectively work on behalf of the people you serve. If you have data about the work you are doing and need some help gleaning insight from it, we can provide that. If you would like to gather data about your programs, we can help design a research protocol and data collection process that fits your needs. These types of services are often cost prohibitive for small to mid-size charities and non-profits. Our goal is to make a broad range of research and analytic services available to organizations for whom in-house expertise may be out of reach.</p>
